# CRUD API endpoints with ExpressJS

## Tutorial
You can find the step by step guide to this project at [http://104.236.81.16:3000/tutorial.html](http://104.236.81.16:3000/tutorial.html).


## Project Details
This project was created as part of the graduate assignment for CSCI E-31 by Nazmus Nasir.

This applications demonstrates a very simple way to create CRUD API endpoints using ExpressJS with the data stored in MongoDB.

## Project Requirements
This project will only show how to create a controller for the CRUD applications.
This assumes that you have a valid database connection established and all dependencies met. In order to proceed, you need the following:


1. **NodeJS** and **NPM**
2. **ExpressJS** - view template not necessary
3. **MongoDB** - connection can be local or remote
4. **Mongoose**

This project assumes that you have ExpressJS installed with a successful connection to MongoDB.
We'll be using methods provided by Mongoose for our queries into the database.

This project will not be using the views generated by Express and we don't need any view templates.

We will create a controller and API end points in an /api folder inside routes. We will cover the following API endpoints:

1. **CREATE** - create a new document within a collection
2. **READ** - read all documents in a collection
3. **UPDATE** - update a single document in a collection
4. **DELETE** - delete a single document in a collection

The READ API will read all data. There will a quick code snippet to read just one document inside the collection but won't be covered in the video.

## Demo
You can play with the demo API by hitting the following URL: [http://104.236.81.16:3000/api/pokemon](http://104.236.81.16:3000/api/pokemon).

You can hit the base URL [http://104.236.81.16:3000](http://104.236.81.16:3000) to test the GET Controller. You can add items to the list using the POST API and refresh this page to see the magic.
